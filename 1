In the Euro area, central counterparty clearing houses (CCPs) are prominent, with ongoing mergers and alliances suggesting a trend towards greater concentration. Leading global investment banks advocate for a single, unified CCP in Europe, capable of handling multiple currencies and financial products, including equities, bonds, derivatives, and commodities.

CCPs play a critical role by acting as intermediaries in transactions, thus guaranteeing against defaults and absorbing systemic risk. They enhance the stability of the financial system. Settlement of securities is managed by Central Securities Depositories (CSDs), which handle the transfer of securities between parties through electronic accounts, a process known as "Delivery vs. Payment" (DvP). This system is vital for transaction efficiency, risk elimination, and proof of ownership.

Trade Repositories (TRs) have emerged to centralize and maintain records of derivative contracts. These entities provide essential data and may offer additional services such as trade matching and portfolio reconciliation.
