Over the past decade, wholesale markets in the European Union have undergone significant changes. In 1998, most wholesale transactions were conducted via telephone, except for Italy's MTS and Greece's HDAT. However, this has shifted dramatically due to various factors. The introduction of the Euro has expanded the market and intensified competition, diminishing the advantages of telephone trading such as privacy and pre-trade knowledge of counterparts. Technological advancements have increased efficiency and competition, driving higher demand.

The Investment Services Directive (ISD) of 1993 allowed financial intermediaries to operate across EU Member States without needing a local branch, promoting cross-border trading. Consequently, the proportion of public bonds held by domestic investors in the Euro area has decreased, with non-resident holdings increasing. This trend, particularly noted in Spain and Belgium, reflects a move towards diversification by investors from other Euro area countries.

The Euro-denominated bond market has increasingly utilized multilateral electronic trading systems, which offer lower costs, greater liquidity, transparency, and facilitate cross-border transactions. While the Euro has accelerated the adoption of these technologies, it is not the sole reason for their growth. By 2000, the MTS group had established several national markets and the EuroMTS in London, becoming a key platform for electronic government bond trading. Although MTS remains influential, its technology now lags behind newer systems.

As of 2012, MTS offers various platforms, including MTS Cash, MTS Repo, MTS BondVision, MTS Credit, MTS Data, and MTS Indices, each serving different aspects of the fixed income market. The market has also embraced high-speed trading platforms, though high-frequency trading in fixed income markets is hindered by bid-offer spreads, connectivity costs, and technological disparities. The European Market Infrastructure Regulation (EMIR) is expected to significantly impact the fixed-income market by mandating central clearing and enhancing access to over-the-counter interest rate products.
