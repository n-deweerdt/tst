In Europe, the market infrastructures for equities, fixed income, and derivatives have undergone significant changes both before and after the implementation of MiFID and the Code of Conduct. Key developments include advancements in trading technologies and the creation of interoperable connections between central counterparty clearing houses (CCPs).

The fixed income market, which comprises government and corporate bonds, is supported by domestic and international infrastructure. Domestic markets are backed by Central Securities Depositories (CSDs), which are evolving to align with the Eurozone standards, with T2S being a significant development. International markets utilize International Central Securities Depositories (ICSDs) to improve efficiency. Most trading in government and corporate bonds occurs bilaterally rather than through multilateral electronic platforms, although automated trading is becoming more common.

The repo market, involving secured financing through repurchase agreements, plays a crucial role by providing temporary liquidity to sellers. The market's infrastructure needs to efficiently handle large sums and tight deadlines, but existing systems are not yet fully optimized for this purpose. Improvements in infrastructure, such as enhancing links between CSDs and ICSDs, are necessary to support efficient collateral transfer across borders.

Custody services, provided by banks and other institutions, are essential for the settlement of securities and the management of investor entitlements. Banks offer specialized services, and global custodians provide comprehensive support across multiple markets.

Central Securities Depositories (CSDs) serve as market utilities to immobilize and electronically transfer securities, facilitating efficient settlement without physical movement. They have become critical to modern securities markets, managing settlement risks and ensuring effective transfer of ownership. Regulatory frameworks, such as EMIR, are being developed to enhance the safety and soundness of these infrastructures, with national central banks and securities authorities overseeing their operations to prevent systemic risk.

Despite the broad implementation of electronic securities, investors continue to use custodians for reasons such as membership eligibility requirements for CSDs and the advantages of custodians' expertise and economies of scale. Custodians help manage securities and ensure compliance with market practices, even as the industry moves towards more electronic and centralized systems.
